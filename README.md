# EM122-ICO
EM122 ICO
Hello everyone.

I am not a legitimate coder or programmer. I have written some code and have created some programs which are useful. I’m very proud of those programs, no matter how small they are, they’re still useful. I also was an online gamer for many years (1998–2013) and during that time I wrote and created 220 gaming maps for 13 different pc games (CoD4, Half-Life, Half-Life 2, Crysis Wars, Crysis2, Quake 3 Arena, Far Cry, 3, F.E.A.R. DM, Quake 2, Quake 4, SOF2, to name a few).

Here is my gaming website: http://gdawgg.com/

Here is my gaming blog http://gdawgg-moosed.blogspot.com/

The blog above is like my gaming history from Wolfenstein 3D (1992) up to 2013. Happy reading.

However, I’m writing today to inform everyone about my new ICO: EM122

https://em122.io/

The website is under construction at the moment and I have much work to do on this entire project however. I’m so totally glad to have arrived at this stage of the development of this coin/token.

I am, by no means a cryptocurrency insider. However, I have been following Bitcoin since it’s inception. I was one of those who tried with zero success to mine Bitcoin on my home pc’s when it first showed up. And, look at it now. December 19th and 20th of 2017 were historic days for all cryptocurrencies but we’ve been losing value ever since.

Certainly no one is happy about that but I’m also certain that there is money to be made from the current slide in value.

Back to EM122, the ICO has begun. The contact address is:

0x85586f8f4e499cbf36c20914db6f2c8b662e8cbc

When you send 1 ETH to this address you will receive 1200 EM122 during the bonus period which ends in three weeks (July 12th) after that, you will receive 1000 EM122 until the 26th of July for every 1 ETH you send.

I need help with my Whitepaper and my Whitelist, if anyone is available to help I would certainly appreciate it.

More information to come very soon. Have a wonderful weekend.
